    “My background was in pharmacy and I didn’t always know I would come into
    basic science research. I was placed in a pharmaceutical company right after
    my Bachelor’s where I worked for a few years before I even considered doing
    a Master’s. Pursuing research was never my goal because I had a family to
    support financially. But the support and encouragement from my mother,
    sister, my best friend (who now happens to be my husband) as well as my
    school, university and company colleagues gave me the courage to resign from
    my job and pursue a life of my own choice.
  </p>
<p>
    It was not easy to shift from a job back to academics initially, but I did
    get into a Master’s program eventually. I was 27 by the time I was ready to
    apply for PhD positions. I was engaged to be married by then. I was
    interviewed for a PhD position in a reputed institute in Kolkata and was
    almost accepted in a laboratory when the professor asked me if I had any
    plans of getting married in the near future. When I disclosed my plans to
    him, he scoffed that I wouldn’t be able to balance my personal and
    professional life and that he wasn’t confident enough to hire me as his
    student.
  </p>
<p>
    I think it was a blessing in disguise that I got rejected because I wouldn’t
    have interviewed in IISc otherwise. I had already started looking for jobs
    again by then and was scared that I might be rejected because the professors
    might doubt the academic credibility of a married woman in PhD. After the
    second round of interview at IISc, I voluntarily went to the professor whose
    laboratory I wanted to join and told him I was soon going to get married. I
    asked him if it would be a problem for him and if so, I could take up the
    job offer I already had in hand. He looked surprised and said he was happy
    for me and it was ridiculous that anybody had ever asked me such questions.
    I eventually joined his laboratory and he is the coolest mentor one could
    ask for.

    When COVID-19 broke out, my husband casually asked me one day if I could
    contribute to the research efforts in any way. I decided to work on a drug
    repurposing project- analysing if the existing drugs in the market could be
    used against COVID-19. When I pitched the idea to my supervisor, he was very
    encouraging but the institute shut down soon and the idea came to a halt. A
    few days later, he called me up and asked if I would like to continue
    working on the idea. I readily agreed although it was difficult to work at
    home on the laptop with limited computational power and a slower internet.
  </p>
<p>
    We came up with a set of drugs in a matter of 15 days and decided to put our
    findings out on the archive at first. The project matured and a few weeks
    ago we submitted our findings in the form of a paper to a journal. It has
    come back with positive comments and some minor revisions which I am
    currently working on.
  </p>
<p>
    Meanwhile, NIBMG Kalyani which had sequenced some viral genomes by taking
    samples from COVID-19 patients with travel/contact history from abroad (and
    one from India) requested our laboratory to help them with some protein
    structural analyses on a few signature mutations found in the sequenced
    genome of the novel coronavirus. It was a Saturday afternoon when my
    supervisor told me about this project; I had no idea about the deadline and
    simply agreed to work on it. Then I got to know we had to submit our results
    by Monday! It was challenging, but in the end, we were able to give some
    useful insights to the project and the paper got subsequently accepted.
  </p>
<p>
    It is exciting that I got almost two papers on COVID-19 in a matter of
    months and could contribute my bit to this pandemic. However, I am concerned
    that my thesis still needs a shape and publications. Future work on COVID-19
    will be carried forward by my juniors now while I focus on getting my
    degree, I have only a year left for it!”

    This was executed by Sohini and Sneha Bheemireddy under the guidance of
    Prof. N. Srinivasan. Sneha would be continuing this project further. The

    It was led by Saumitra Das of NIBMG Kalyani. The work was also featured in <a href=" https://www.anandabazar.com/amp/state/corona-virus-europe-connection-has-worsened-infection-scenario-in-state-1.1150456?fbclid=IwAR2znZg4EYhZcoQHQj2wOvtJbggld_SlN1FwBK3ksM2UhJ0cn9DbWWlT5oc"> Anand Bazar </a>
