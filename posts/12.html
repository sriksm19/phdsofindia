    “I would keep myself updated and share recent findings on the novel
    coronavirus with my peers when the pandemic first started. I wasn’t
    initially a part of the core team but later my supervisor subtly asked if I
    would be interested. I jumped at the opportunity. Who would miss a chance
    like that?

    It was our supervisor’s idea to use CRISPR/Cas9 instead of the conventional
    RT-PCR as a diagnostic tool for COVID-19. We didn’t face much problems in
    terms of reagents and the setup because our laboratory was already equipped
    with all the tools; we have been extensively working on genome editing of
    sickle cell anemia by CRISPR/Cas9. Our goal was to develop a testing kit
    that was fast, cost effective and required lesser reagents.
  </p>
  <p>
    The initial optimization was obviously time consuming. We had to work day in
    and day out. I remember we once worked for 48 hours at a stretch with hardly
    any break! Although there was a lot of excitement and adrenaline rush, it
    did get excessively tiring too. But in the end our hard work paid off and we
    came out with a testing kit which could diagnose COVID-19 in an hour.
  </p>
  <p>
    The kit is called FELUDA after the famous Bengali detective.
    Co-incidentally, the Cas9 protein which we have used in the kit comes from a
    bacterium with the initial F. It simply clicked for us.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently the process of scaling up and marketing it for the general public
    is being done by our commercial partners. We hope it will be ready to use
    soon.

  <p>
    Throughout these 2–3 months my family has been very supportive, particularly
    my mother. I was surprised by her reaction because I thought she would be
    the first one to panic. When I told her I would be working on the virus
    instead of going home during the lockdown, she was not at all upset. Instead
    she asked me questions about my work and how we could raise awareness in
    society. I have had prior training in explaining science to common people in
    the simplest way possible, so it was easy to convey my work to her. She now
    goes and explains it to the rest of the community back at my native place
    and can tackle questions on the coronavirus better than me! I am more proud
    of her than she is of me and now I can’t wait to go back home.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have just started training a bigger team for the task and hopefully in a
    couple of weeks, I will finally be able to take a break.”

    Editor’s note: The FELUDA testing kit has been made by a team of 5 people:
    Mohd. Azhar, Rhythm Phutela, Riya Rauthan, Asgar Hussain and Manoj Kumar
    himself. Dipanjali Sinha and Sundaram Acharya contributed in developing the
    final form of the FELUDA kit. This team was mentored by senior scientists
    Dr. Souvik Maiti and Dr. Debojyoti Chakraborty.
  </p>
  <p>
    The team has partnered with TATA SONS which will soon take over testing and
    marketing the FELUDA kit.

    The team’s work has also been featured in a number of eminent publications,
