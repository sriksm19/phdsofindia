    “You will not be able to make it to any good institute for your Masters” my
    undergraduate professor had once shouted at me for simply sharing a joke in
    class.
  </p>
<p>
    The words echoed distantly in my ears as I stepped into one of the most
    premier institutes of the country to do my Masters. PhD was never part of
    the plan, it had always been eventually cracking the UPSC. At first I took
    it up without deep thought, thinking I can manage UPSC preparations on the
    side. But slowly day by day, piece by piece, I started enjoying what I did.
    I started loving Science.
  </p>
<p>
    But there are other challenges. I am the first person in my family pursuing
    a PhD. I am 28 and unmarried. Women in my family get married by 25. My
    parents are now concerned about my wedding. Sometimes I feel I am hurting
    them with my choice, that I am doing something wrong. But I keep pushing
    nevertheless.
  </p>
<p>
    In addition, sometimes it becomes more challenging because I get very little
    support from my supervisor. I had a difficult time when I started out
    because I didn’t have very friendly labmates either. With time, the
    environment vastly improved but my supervisor didn’t. He even texts me on
    Sundays to come to work sometimes. I find this unprofessional.
  </p>
<p>
    I think this is a big problem Indians in academia face, the lack of
    professionalism between both teachers and students. Instead of developing
    our scientific acumen, almost half our time is spent in doing clerical tasks
    like grading papers, ordering laboratory equipment and reagents, managing
    bills; there is little to no time left for self study and strengthening our
    literature.
  </p>
<p>
    I have been really overwhelmed with everything lately, so for my peace of
    mind during these crazy times, I have blocked my supervisor on WhatsApp. For
    now at least. I need a break!
