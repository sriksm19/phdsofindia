    “I had been interested in genomics since my Bachelor’s and chose it as my
    specialization during Master’s because of the scope of this field. When I
    received my first project during PhD, I couldn’t find myself actively
    engaging in it and my interest wavered. Luckily my supervisor allowed me to
    work on a different question, more challenging this time. It was one of the
    hardest decisions I had to take but I am glad I chose this project which has
    now given me the chance to work with COVID-19.
  </p>
<p>
    Our institute got an opportunity to voluntarily participate in COVID-19
    testing and research, from the time this pandemic started gaining ground in
    India. It wasn’t mandatory for us to take part but I was enthusiastic and
    eventually became a part of the COVID-19 core team.
  </p>
<p>
    I had heard from one of my Master’s professors earlier that Indian genomic
    databases lag behind those of Europe and the US and she had told us we must
    try to bridge this gap if we ever go into research. Coincidentally, my
    supervisor felt similarly and that’s how I ended up becoming an active
    member of the IndiGen program prior to the spread of the novel coronavirus.
    We had the task of whole genome sequencing of one thousand healthy Indian
    individuals. The overall aim of IndiGen is to undertake whole genome
    sequencing of Indians from diverse ethnic groups and form a repository which
    can eventually help in screening procedures for genetic disease conditions
    and help during pandemics like COVID-19. We managed to sequence a thousand
    genomes within six months and currently with the pandemic in place, we are
    working on its analysis and implementation for the betterment of public
    health in India.
  </p>
<p>
    Apart from that, I regularly distribute personal protective gear (masks,
    gloves, sanitizers) to the non-academic staff and it feels satisfying
    explaining to them the science around COVID-19. I also work as an aid-on
    person for the seniors who have been handling the RNA samples directly.
  </p>
<p>
    When we started working on COVID-19, there were a lot of uncertainties and
    lack of knowledge about the virus and its transmission; we had to optimize
    everything ranging from experiments to safety protocols. It took time but
    now we are prepared to chalk out the details of this pandemic no matter what
    stage it is in.
  </p>
<p>
    With modern science and technology I personally don’t think it would take
    very long to produce the vaccine. Many countries are actively working on it
    right at this moment.
  </p>
<p>
    India is also doing its bit but unfortunately we are significantly setback
    in our approaches. No one saw the coming of this black swan event and the
    whole world got hit very hard as we weren’t prepared.
  </p>
<p>
    We fear that the worst is yet to come in the country, so we will all soon be
    actively working on combating the infection and not just be auxiliary to the
    bigger team. More specifically many of us will be utilizing our genomic
    expertise in diagnosis and disease surveillance. The coming weeks are going
    to be really stressful for us. Let’s all hope for the best.”

    Editor’s Note: The first Indian Genome was announced on 8th November, 2009
    in the Indian Parliament by Shri Prithviraj Chauhan, Minister of State
    (Independent Charge) of Science and Technology.

    The objective of IndiGen is to create a pilot dataset to enable genetic
    epidemiology of carrier genetic diseases and enable affordable carrier
    screening approaches in India. IndiGen also aims to mine allelic frequencies
    of genetic variants to estimate the population scale prevalence of these
    variants. These human genome datasets will also be used for prioritizing
    pharmacogenomic variants specific for the Indian population. This can be
    used to optimize therapy and minimize adverse events during drug
    administrations. It is funded by the Council for Scientific and Industrial
    Research (CSIR).
