    “I was quite nervous on the day of my defense. I woke up early, got myself a
    badly needed haircut and for the first time in ages, put on my formals. When
    I arrived for my defense my professors were surprised I even owned a pair of
    trousers!

    In my second paper, which was single-authored, I had used a result deduced
    by one of the stalwarts in my field. There was a small step in that paper
    which my advisor told me to cross-check but, partly because of the
    reputation of the author, I had not. That paper went in my thesis. During
    revision of my paper for submission to a journal, I realised that the step I
    had omitted to cross check was wrong. It invalidated my thesis! It was a
    moment of panic. I thought my PhD was about to go up in flames before my
    eyes. I brainstormed with my advisor for hours but to no avail. Later that
    evening, an idea struck me and it worked. I corrected my thesis. It is scary
    to think what would have happened if it had not worked! I was still worried
    about any further mistakes in my thesis and this is what made me so nervous
    that morning. But thankfully my defense went smoothly and I was awarded the
    doctorate degree. Lesson learnt: cross-check even the trivial-looking steps
    that you use and don’t trust papers by the reputation of their authors.

    My PhD journey was not smooth sailing though. My project required a certain
    mathematical background which I did not have. Instead of seeking help from
    my advisor who was very patient and helpful, I tried to acquire the
    background on my own. But without a proper roadmap, progress was slow and
    made me frustrated often. I had high expectations and a low tolerance for
    frustration. So whenever I was stuck in my project, I indulged in escapism,
    wasting hours on social media.

    It was the pressure to finish up and get my degree that eventually brought
    me back on track. My advisor also realised that he should not cut me any
    more slack! Another thing that helped was the arrival of a young Professor
    in the same field, who quickly became a friend and something of a mentor
    figure to me. I was comfortable discussing my problems with him and those
    discussions, despite being casual, helped immensely. I might have left
    physics if he had not been around.”
