    “I was very close to my grandmother. When she fell sick, I was the one who
    would bring her medicines, thinking I could save her life with those. I was
    intrigued by the composition of the drugs she was given and would wonder how

    But when I had to leave home for my Master’s, I became terribly homesick. I
    could barely survive. My academic performances suffered too. Those two years
    were the hardest period of my life.
  </p>
<p>
    Although I wanted to do research I didn’t want to stay away from my family,
    my biggest support system. I guess I didn’t want to choose between the two
    because they were both equally important to me.

<p>
    I was on cloud nine when I got through the PhD program at NII. It meant I
    could pursue my passion yet not be away from home. Perhaps that’s why in all
    these five years I never had a breakdown, I always had my family around me.
    Obviously life during PhD is stressful but the stress never bogged me down.

<p>
    On a different note, I have never been a topper in my class. I have always
    lacked the energy or patience to cover each and every topic of my syllabus
    but given my 100% to the subjects I did study and scored the highest in
    those. My teachers loved me for that. That’s a quality I have retained in my
    PhD too. I put my soul into what I do and that’s what you need in the long
    run to survive in this field. Focus on your goal is the key to getting that
    degree. Also sometimes you don’t need to choose between family and career,
    they can go hand in hand.”
