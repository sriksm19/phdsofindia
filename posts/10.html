title:  COVID-19 Special-- An asset to a pandemic
description:  I quit a fancy high paying job to do research which paid almost five times
    less because it was something I had dreamt of since I was 10.

    “Since most of my work is computational, our team was sent home right after
    the nationwide lockdown was imposed. And soon after, our advisor started
    emailing us projects on COVID-19. It was at a time when most of us didn’t
    even have any idea about the severity of infection across the world!
  </p>
<p>
    When the news channels became all about the coronavirus, I realized the
    gravity of the situation and I felt that the work I was assigned might prove
    impactful for the society. After all, that’s why I shifted to biology from a
    computer science engineering background. What is the point of being a PhD
    student in a biological field if you cannot be an asset to a pandemic like
    this!
  </p>
<p>
    My work at the moment is to cumulate the available data from the dataset
    available online and predict the evolutionary history of the virus in India
    and where it is likely to spread the most. We recently found out that there
    are six sub-groups of the virus in India; none of the data we have so far
    indicates the extent of their pathogenicity though.
  </p>
<p>
    We published this information through our website GenomeConnect and it got
    13k views on Twitter in a single day. Friends from my engineering college
    who had initially thought I have taken a wrong decision by changing fields,
    now call me up and ask me questions about the virus. I feel important but at
    the same time I am stressed too because I am working on something that is
    real-time.
  </p>
<p>
    I wake up in the morning, do my daily chores and sit with my computer,
    coding for hours together. My family keeps complaining that despite being at
    home, they hardly get to see me. But they are proud too for my contribution
    in a crisis like this. I hope I can make a difference to this society as I
    have always wanted.”

    Editor’s note: Bani had requested us to put up the photograph of her working
    desk at IGIB which she really misses.
