title: Living life from one high to another!
description:  I quit a fancy high paying job to do research which paid almost five times
    less because it was something I had dreamt of since I was 10.

    “I had been average in academics throughout my IITB journey. Robotics
    interested me but it never reflected on my academic performances until my
    BTech+MTech dual degree thesis. There I worked in collaboration with Dr.
    Manish Agarwal from Tata Memorial Hospital on designing of instruments for
    knee replacement. My thesis examiner was so impressed that he actually told
    me it was the best thesis he had ever seen.
  </p>
<p>
    After graduating, I worked for a few months in a supply chain industry but I
    felt so bored at my job that I just quit without notice. Well, I did have to
    go back later to submit my resignation and was told off for it. I paid them
    back so as to escape serving the conventional notice period.
  </p>
<p>
    Then I began to wonder what it was I wanted to do. I put together my love
    for coding and robotics with my passion for the Master’s thesis project. I
    told my master’s advisor about my idea of taking the project further and
    working on it. At first I didn’t imagine myself doing a PhD but my advisor
    very mildly pitched it as an option that would pay decently while I could
    continue working on my dream project. He also suggested that I could earn
    more by doing some managerial work for the laboratory if I wanted. I
    therefore took up the offer.
  </p>
<p>
    I finished up most of my PhD work (XrayTo3D) within the first three years
    itself. My advisor was an amazing person. He believed only 33% of our focus
    should be on the work we do, the rest should be on other things including
    our personal life. He also knew the importance of industrial collaborations
    and inspired me to pitch my project on different platforms besides just
    working on it. Furthermore, IITB provided enough funds to travel worldwide
    and it was easy for me to grab every opportunity I could get and showcase my
    project to the world.
  </p>
<p>
    I was invited to Rashtrapati Bhavan once where I stayed for about 2–3 weeks.
    During my stay, I even got the opportunity to talk about my work with PM
    Narendra Modi. I went to Silicon Valley twice. Once it was during the same
    time when PM Modi was doing his foreign tours back in 2014. I was invited to
    his talk there. I remember receiving royal treatment.
  </p>
<p>
    One of my best travel experiences was completing the Machu Picchu hike at
    Peru during one of my conferences where I was the keynote speaker. I was on
    an all time high. Today I shudder to think of the risky journey I so happily
    undertook amidst a bunch of strangers in a country where no one knew me. I
    miss being so carefree.
  </p>
<p>
    After getting my doctorate degree, I spent several more years establishing
    my startup Algosurg in IITB’s startup incubator SINE. It later moved to the
    US. I spent 14 years of my life inside the campus and it has made me who I
    am today. I enjoyed my time there whole heartedly.
  </p>
<p>
    The closest I have come to mental health issues was when my physician
    thought my regular stomach problems could be linked to stress and my
    psychological well being. My psychologist however thought I was perfectly
    fine and I remember joking with my then girlfriend that she was the only
    possible source of stress. Later it turned out I was simply allergic to the
    cooking oil used in the campus mess. I had to apologize to my girlfriend
    after that!
  </p>
<p>
    Work has never felt like work because it has always been so close to my
    heart. Our future goal is to help perform robotic surgeries. I believe with
    the advent of automation, a surgeon’s role will be very different in future
    and we would be able to vastly reduce their workload as well as increase
    accessibility to healthcare for a lot of people.”
