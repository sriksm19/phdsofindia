title: My persistent path to PhD
description:  I had wanted to pursue biotechnology ever since I was introduced to the
    subject in Class XII. Back then, the internet was not available in every
    house. I had to go to cyber cafes every now and then and spend hours looking
    for colleges that taught biotechnology as a major. I was so fixated on
    pursuing it that I settled for an average college despite having offers from
    better universities in other life sciences disciplines.

    “I had wanted to pursue biotechnology ever since I was introduced to the
    subject in Class XII. Back then, the internet was not available in every
    house. I had to go to cyber cafes every now and then and spend hours looking
    for colleges that taught biotechnology as a major. I was so fixated on
    pursuing it that I settled for an average college despite having offers from
    better universities in other life sciences disciplines. The laboratory
    conditions were pitiful and I could barely develop any practical knowledge
    during my time there. I tried to make up for it by taking up internships
    every semester break.

    After BTech, I wanted to study further and eventually a PhD in the field. I
    lacked information about the entrance examinations and therefore I missed
    the opportunity to get through any good, government institute for MTech. To
    avoid putting my family under financial burden, I started looking for
    private colleges that offered scholarships. Eventually I found one and yet
    again, settled for mediocrity.

    When I heard about the IRCC internship program at IITB, I instantly applied
    for it. I spent 6 months in the Biosciences Department there, learning the
    most basic of laboratory techniques. It was so enriching that I wanted to
    come back to IITB. However, instead of Biosciences, I secured a PhD position
    in the Chemical Engineering department where I currently work.

    Being in one of the country’s best institutes comes with huge
    responsibilities and expectations from my supervisor. I am always overloaded
    with work, handling multiple projects at a time. Impressed with my hard work
    and perseverance, my supervisor sent me on a short collaborative project to
    University of California, Berkeley at the end of my first year of PhD. I
    learnt a lot there and I am sure this opportunity is going to help me in
    later stages of academia.

    But there are times when I fail to impress my supervisor and get
    demotivated. My boyfriend jokes that I am VVS Lakshman of the Indian cricket
    team who’s meant for test matches instead of T20 and if I can just stay on
    the field for a little longer, India will win the match.

    I am learning a technique now during quarantine which none of my peers have
    experience with. My supervisor keeps scolding me on Zoom meetings saying
    that my progress is slow. I don’t feel bad because in this lockdown when I
    am away from the campus, he is taking care of my plants which I left with
    him. Well, that was in return for me grading 177 papers in less than a day
    for him before leaving!”

    The IRCC or Industrial Research and Consultancy Centre floats
    internship opportunities every year in the form of specific research
    projects and selects candidates through a rigorous selection procedure. This
    is a paid internship of four to six months and provides an opportunity to
    participate in the numerous research and development activities at IIT
    Bombay.
