    “The moment I stepped into IIT Bombay, I knew I wanted to be there. This
    place had the very environment I wanted (including playgrounds and people to
    play with!). My PhD interviews there went really well and I was hoping for a
    positive outcome.

    I was in Bangalore, interviewing for IISc when the list of selected
    candidates for PhD at IITB came out. I remember sitting outside the
    interview room and checking my phone for the results. I didn’t see my name
    the first time I opened the website and before I could wait to refresh the
    page, I was called in for my microbiology interview. The first thing I was
    asked was to spell Escherichia coli on the board and the interviewers
    playfully congratulated me on being the first person to actually spell it
    right!
  </p>
<p>
    When I stepped out and checked the IITB website again, I found out I had
    indeed got into my dream institute. I still decided to go for one more
    interview at NCBS Bangalore just for the experience and I wanted to meet my
    friends who were also going there. I was the last person to be called in
    there and when I entered, one of the interviewers exclaimed “Oh you aren’t a
    girl. I was expecting a girl!”. “Sorry to disappoint you ma’am”, I quipped
    back!

    I have been fortunate to receive good laboratory exposures and mentorship
    throughout my college life. It got me a good number of publications even
    before I had embarked on my PhD journey.
  </p>
<p>
    My laboratory in IITB is equally good. I hardly face any problem with my
    colleagues or my supervisor here. Obviously, there are days when it is hard
    to stay motivated. Motivation in PhD is like a sine curve, with its own ups
    and downs. I start my experiments with the confidence that I will make it
    work in one shot, but it doesn’t always happen and I get immensely upset.
    That is perhaps the only challenge I face. My supervisor is one of the best
    human beings I have come across in my life and all my peers have the freedom
    to barge into his office whenever faced with a problem. He is always there
    to help.

    My research is fueled by passion but life can get monotonous at times. I
    recommend everyone in this field to inculcate at least one hobby where they
    can find some solace. When I am not doing science, I like to sketch and try
    out new art ideas. Along with that, I am learning graphic designing and
    sometimes do small scale freelancing projects. I would have been almost as
    happy doing this full time if it absolutely had to be something else. But
    honestly I wouldn’t have it any other way!”

    When Parijat talked about his talent for graphic designing,
    we immediately jumped on the opportunity and asked him to design a logo for
    ‘PhDs of India’. And he very kindly did. Thank you Parijat!
