    “I come from a region infamous for child marriages. I am however lucky to
    have been born to reasonably supportive parents who allowed me to pursue
    higher studies. I still had to choose between preparing for government jobs
    by staying back home or being with my husband who had just started his PhD.
    I obviously chose the latter and enrolled myself in the same programme.
    That’s how I ended up becoming a researcher!

    During my PhD, in a joint collaboration, both me and my husband had the
    opportunity to travel abroad. The environment abroad was completely
    different and people worked much longer hours than I was used to. It was
    highly stressful and I had trouble adjusting. I started taking too much
    pressure and thought I would be judged if I asked basic questions. One day
    it became so overwhelming that I came home and broke down completely. I had
    no idea how to cope. I felt lost. My husband calmed me down and suggested I
    talk to my advisor in person. I put together a frantic email with the
    subject, “Need Help!” He responded immediately and asked me to see him at
    his office.

<p>
    I prepared myself the entire night and was determined I wouldn’t cry in
    front of him. But the moment I went to his cabin, I broke into tears again.
    My advisor was startled. He asked me to take a deep breath and tell him what
    the problem was. I told him everything, how it was becoming difficult to
    cope in a foreign environment, that I was scared to ask questions because I
    feared being judged and so on.
  </p>
<p>
    He listened to me patiently for more than an hour. He even wrote down on a
    piece of paper whatever I had to say and assured me that I could go up to
    him for any help I needed. He said he wouldn’t judge me if I asked stupid
    questions and that he would make sure I was okay in the laboratory. I felt a
    huge burden lift off of my shoulders. It felt so good to talk to him! It was
    only because of his understanding and support that I didn’t quit my PhD.
    That conversation was a turning point in my PhD journey.

    When I was travelling to India for a winter break that December, I got to
    know in the airport that my first paper had gotten rejected. I was
    devastated. From the reviewers’ comments I could tell they hadn’t understood
    the paper but had all the power to accept or reject it. I almost felt like
    quitting a second time but didn’t give up because of the support from my
    family, friends and especially my advisor.
</p>
<p>
    I re-submitted my paper and it got finally accepted in April! This was a
    huge personal achievement and it’s hard to describe in words how proud I
    felt. I feel good about my decision to stay in PhD, and confident of the
    journey ahead. Here’s what I would like to tell anyone thinking of doing a
    PhD in India- “Having a great mentor is the most important part of your PhD
    journey. Hence choose wisely. Do lab rotations, interact with different
    professors. This is like a life-long relationship. If you have a good
    mentor, you can reach the stars.”
