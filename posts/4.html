    “I hadn’t stepped out of my home town for over 21 years. When I got accepted
    to one of the best institutes of the country for a master’s and had to leave
    home, I was extremely scared, scared that I suddenly had to manage
    everything on my own. I wondered how I was going to survive, whether I would
    be accepted among the brilliant minds there.

    On the day of admission I saw all these smart, confident, sophisticated
    people around me and it intimidated me even further. I come from a lower
    middle class family and I felt like I didn’t belong, that I wouldn’t be able
    to fit in. There were people from all over the country: different states and
    cultures. I even remember telling my mother I didn’t want to study there!
  </p>
<p>
    But I did get admitted and eventually with time and a great set of friendly
    batchmates, I adapted to the new environment. I learnt to be more confident.

    I have always loved Biology. Initially, due to lack of exposure and
    opportunities in school, I believed medical sciences was the only profession
    I could pursue if I wanted to study the subject. When that didn’t work out
    and I enrolled myself for a Bachelor’s in the same, I realized the diversity
    and potential of this field. It was a whole new, fascinating world for me.
  </p>
<p>
    Personally as well as academically I had a great time throughout the
    journey, until my Masters’ supervisor asked me to convert into a PhD student
    in the same laboratory. I rejected that proposal and he didn’t take it well.
    When I was leaving the institute and went to bid him adieu, instead of
    encouraging me for the future, he retorted, “If you ever get through the PhD
    program in this institute, it will be because of me. Trust me, it will be
    really difficult out there for you.”
  </p>
<p>
    His words stung bad but I wasn’t deterred. I believe in earning my
    opportunities rather than taking someone’s discouragement as my fate.
    Unfortunately at various times it has been other researchers who have
    discouraged me more than anyone else. At that point of time, I felt like
    someone had challenged my very interest in research although he himself was
    an admirer of my work.
  </p>
<p>
    I worked day and night on my PhD applications to various Indian institutes
    and eventually found myself working with one of the finest minds in my
    field. She is also currently the editor of some of the top scientific
    journals in the world.

    Last year, I bumped into my Masters’ supervisor at a conference. He was
    shocked to know that I was a student of such a renowned scientist, someone
    he himself looks up to. The look on his face was priceless. And at that
    moment I knew, the only one who can limit me, my potential, my confidence,
    is me! Not my Masters’ supervisor nor anyone else.
  </p>
<p>
    I no more doubt myself. I know I am capable enough to contribute something
    significant to my field and I am determined to do it.”
